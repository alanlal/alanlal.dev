Welcome to my blog,

I'm a passionate software engineer with a lifelong fascination for coding.I've been a software engineer for the past 5 years, focusing on backend development. I work with java on a day to day basis and sometimes fiddle with python and go.

I'm currently working in [DLTLedgers](https://dltledgers.com/), where I'm developing decentralized applications for international trade orchestration using Java and Corda.

**What I'm working on:** Currently creating a small code interpreter based on Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). You can check the code out [here](https://github.com/alanlal/jinterpreter)

**What I'm currently learning:** I'm learning more about kuberenetes and how it works with the devops pipline using [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-devops-the-complete-kubernetes-course)
